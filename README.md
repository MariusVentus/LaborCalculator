# LaborCalculator
A quick calculator which takes raw notes and adds up the numbers up row by row.
Only ever adds the last number in a row.
It also automatically puts the cleaned notes into your clipboard for pasting.

Also has an ignore list, just in case a specific combination of numbers and letters are frequently used.

***Release Notes***
V0.0.0 - Project Start!

V0.0.1 - "Clean, Calc, and Copy" button implemented. Ignore list working, and it can be accessed from the File menu. Also Icons real quick. Demo!

V0.0.2 - Generator added which randomly generates expected labor from a period of time, automatically assumes 6 hours, quick access to settings file added.

V0.0.3 - Added Generator window for the input of hours. Determined that Settings button not optimal for generator settings, since it effectively requires altering the config. Added manual instead.

V0.0.4 - Quick update to the Generator. Now when asking about Hours owned, it can take numbers with decimals, although it still rounds to nearest integer. 

***Planned Features (Warning: Doing this for fun in my free time. Updates will be slow, if at all)***

1.) Improved code (As always, this is just a quick project, so main.cpp is spaghetti)

2.) AI Generator - Ability to feed raw notes about user actions and expected labor into an AI, and then train the AI to guestamate labor from new notes.
Currently, hardware limitations make this a far-off goal.
